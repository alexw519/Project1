NextStep is a web and mobile friendly application uniquely designed to provide users and their partner with their compatibility and 
provide users with personalized date suggestions to take a relationship to the "next step" :heart:

## Overview
### How does it work?
Using cutting-edge technology, we have utilized an interactive love calculator API to determine whether or not you and your crush are the perfect match. Once we calculate you and your crushes' compatibility, our app uses your own preferences and provides couples
with our recommendations to take things to the "next step". Our method is simple: enter your names, ages, locations, and preferences for a desired date and NextStep will provide users with personalized recommendations for an accessible and customized date night. Interact with our fun and dynamic application to get your own customized date today!
