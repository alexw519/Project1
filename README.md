# NextStep

This project is designed to provide personalized date suggestions to take a relationship to the "next step".

## Overview
### How does it work?
Using cutting-edge technology, we have utilized an innovative API love calculator to determine whether or not you and your crush are the perfect match! Depending on your calculated compatibility, our app uses your own preferences, and using applications such as google maps, provides people and their crush with our recommendations to take things to the "next step". Interact with our fun and dynamic application to get your own customized date today. 

## Built With
HTML
CSS
Javascript
Materialize - The web framework used

## Future Recommendations
Adding more events around town i.e. concerts, plays, galleries
Adding an advice column with suggested conversation starters
Future development to have an entire date night planned for them
